Let me know if that basic layout is okay. The table should expand downward
as stuff is added to it (via JS or whatever).

Obviously the big 'Month' will change to reflect the actual month, and Store
1 thru 5 will reflect the actual stores.

The items under 'Tasks' would likely popup another window (or not?) to do
whatever they say and notifications will expand whenever stuff is added to
it.

If this is really bad (I don't think it is, but what do I know :P ) please
let me know and I can try to fix it.
